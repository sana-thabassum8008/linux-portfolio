## Project Overview

This portfolio consolidates a series of hands-on challenges focused on Linux operating systems and shell scripting. The aim was to simulate real-world system management scenarios and develop automated solutions. All tasks were successfully completed and documented.

## Key Skills Demonstrated

Through this challenge, I've gained and demonstrated proficiency in:

* *Linux System Administration:* File and directory management, user and group management, permissions, process control, disk usage analysis, network configuration, and firewall management.
* *Shell Scripting (Bash):* Writing robust scripts for automation, including error handling, scheduling with Cron, system resource monitoring, and bulk user management.
* *Problem-Solving:* Ability to interpret requirements, troubleshoot issues, and implement effective solutions in a Linux environment.
* *Documentation:* Clearly documenting steps, commands, and project outcomes.

## Project Sections / Tasks

This project is divided into the following key areas, each demonstrating specific Linux and scripting capabilities:

1.  *Basic Linux Commands:*
    * Creating and navigating directory structures.
    * File management (creating, copying, adding content).
    * Managing file and directory permissions (owner-only, group access, public readability).

2.  *User and Group Management:*
    * Creating new users and setting passwords.
    * Creating groups and adding users to specific groups.
    * Managing user permissions for directories.
    * Displaying disk usage.

3.  *Process Management:*
    * Listing all running processes.
    * Starting and managing background processes (e.g., timestamp logger).
    * Identifying and terminating processes.
    * Monitoring CPU and memory usage snapshots.

4.  *Networking:*
    * Displaying current network configuration.
    * Performing ping tests.
    * Listing open ports (ss command).
    * Firewall configuration (UFW installation, enabling, and rule management for HTTP/HTTPS).

5.  *Shell Scripting:*
    * **backup.sh**: A script to compress and backup a specified directory with error handling.
    * **cleanup.sh**: An automation script to delete files older than 7 days from a backup directory, scheduled for daily execution using Cron.
    * **resource_monitor.sh (Advanced):** A script capable of monitoring CPU, memory, and disk usage, with integrated logic to send email alerts if resource thresholds are exceeded.
    * **bulk_user_add.sh (User Management Automation):** A script to read usernames from a list, create users with default passwords, add them to a specific group, and ensure home directory creation.
